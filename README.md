## 💡 Project Overview  

> *“Imagine drawing water from a well, unaware it contains arsenic or fluoride that silently harms health over years.”*  

This is the **reality for many communities in India**, where **over 60% of the population depends on groundwater**.  

Groundwater is India’s lifeline — supporting drinking, agriculture, and daily needs for millions. Yet, it is increasingly threatened by **toxic contamination** from:  
- 🧪 Arsenic  
- 💧 Fluoride  
- 🌱 Nitrate  
- ☢️ Uranium  
- ⚙️ Iron  

This project leverages the **CGWB (2023) groundwater quality dataset** to identify unsafe drinking water zones across India through **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and geospatial mapping**.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- 📊 **Dataset Acquisition** → Use authentic CGWB (2023) dataset  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** → Cleaning, standardization & handling missing values  
- 🔎 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Detect contamination trends  
- ✅ **Safe Limit Benchmarking** → Compare against **WHO/BIS standards**  
- 🗺️ **Unsafe Zone Identification** → Graphs, heatmaps, and maps  
- 📈 **Future Scope** → Build an **interactive dashboard** for exploration

## 📂 Dataset  

**Source:** Central Ground Water Board, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Govt. of India  
**Dataset:** *Ground Water Quality of Unconfined Aquifers (2023)*  

🔹 **Coverage:** States, Districts, Sampling Locations  
🔹 **Parameters:**  
- Physical: *pH, Electrical Conductivity, Hardness*  
- Major Ions: *Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, NO₃⁻, PO₄³⁻, Ca, Mg, K*  
- Contaminants: *F⁻, Fe, U, Arsenic*  

📍 Includes **Latitude & Longitude** → enables **geospatial hotspot mapping**

## ⚙️ Workflow  

1. 🌐 **Web scraping** of CGWB dataset  
2. 🧹 **Data preprocessing & cleaning**  
3. 📑 **Standardized dataset creation**  
4. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis** of contaminants  
5. 🗺️ **Mapping unsafe zones** with GIS & heatmaps

## 📊 Expected Outcomes  

✔️ **Groundwater Insights** → Contamination patterns across India  
✔️ **Unsafe Zone Maps** → Risk visualization (heatmaps & GIS)  
✔️ **Data-Driven Evidence** → Clear graphs & documentation  
✔️ **Policy & Research Support** → Aid for Govt. & NGOs  
✔️ **Public Awareness** → Visuals that highlight urgency  
✔️ **Interactive Dashboard (Future)** → Region-wise water quality explorer
